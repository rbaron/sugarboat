# MPU-6050
* [Datasheet](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf)
* [Register map](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Register-Map1.pdf)
* It's a 6 degrees of freedom IMU
  * Accelerometer with 3 axes => Reads
  * Gyroscope with 3 axes
* But also has a built-in "MotionFusion" Digital Motion Processor (DMP)
  * "Offloads computation of motion processing algorithms" from the host processor (?)
  * Generates "sensor fusion data" (?)
  * So it becomes a 9-axis sensor
  * Somehow lets us extract the orientation from the accelerometer + gyro
  * Apparently [not publicly documented](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/blob/master/Arduino/MPU6050/MPU6050.h#L731)
  * [This GitHub comment](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/issues/528#issuecomment-611634501) links to a PDF containing the specs of the firmware that powers the DMP
  * [Clear explanation of the DMP](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/issues/190#issuecomment-144270345) by the author of i2cdevlibA

 ## Calibration
 ```
 [-1743,-1742] --> [-7,11]  [719,720] --> [-7,5]    [1101,1101] --> [16381,16386]   [100,101] --> [0,3]     [60,61] --> [0,4]       [1,1] --> [0,1]

 [-1743,-1742]
 [719,720]
 [1101,1101]
 [100,101]
 [60,61]
 [1,1]
 ```

 ## How to calculate the tilt?
 Tilt: the angle between the sensor and the original's frame Z axis (or equivalently the gravity)

 The sensor gives us a quaternion.

### Euler angles

### Row pitch yaw
